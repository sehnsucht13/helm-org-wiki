* Features
** Create new section
This command should have 2 flavours, it should let you create a new section anywhere in the wiki along with a starter file. Additionally, it should let you create a new article in the current section.
** Traversal
There should be 3 commands for traversal
 - Index.org
 - From the root of the wiki
 - Current section

** Links
There should either be links to things inside of the file or a system must be implemented where we switch between articles. Need to research links to see how difficult it would be to implement.

** Code blocks
This problem has been solved.

** Templates
Add in the option for a basic template for export to be automatically added.
